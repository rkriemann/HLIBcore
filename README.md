HLIBcore
========

*HLIBcore* contains basic type definitions and function implementations from (hlibpro.com)[HLIBpro]
needed by (libhlr.org)[libHLR], e.g., matrix types, clustering algorithms and input/output
functions. 

The API is 100% compatible to *HLIBpro*, i.e., you can directly replace *HLIBcore* with *HLIBpro*.
However, all the arithmetic functions for H-matrices and even basic matrix construction is missing.
For this, please use the functions provided by *libHLR*.
